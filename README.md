# Open Type

A public package CDN for open typefaces that have no other place on the web to call home.

## Contributing

Please **do not** just suggest open typefaces as tickets/issues. Instead open a proper pull request following the guidelines of adding a typeface.

## Before you open a PR

1. Make sure the typeface isn't hosted on other CDNs (unpkg, google fonts, etc)
 - This project is for typefaces not currently supported by other CDNs
2. Make sure the typeface is in fact licensed as open source and free to redistribute


## Guidelines for adding typefaces

Use the default `Cantarell` as a blueprint for adding your typeface. The fonts need to be in their own parent folder, with an `index.css` and `files` folder (which will contain the corresponding fonts).
